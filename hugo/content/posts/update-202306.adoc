title: "Commanding Manual added"

We added a new document to this set of CGSE documentation: _The Ground Tests Commanding Manual_. This is a manual originally written in Microsoft Word, but it was long not updated because the manual became too big and Word too slow to comfortably make changes.

We have updated the content of this manual to match the current system behaviour and functionality. In a future update we will add content that is found necessary while executing the ground tests.

:relfilesuffix: /

You can access the manual from this web site if you navigate to the _Docs_ part from the top right, or use the following link: xref:commanding-manual.adoc[commanding-manual].
