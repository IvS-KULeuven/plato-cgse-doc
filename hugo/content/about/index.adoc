Although we try hard to write good and clean code, we feel the need to provide documentation about the Common-EGSE on several levels.

In GitHub issues, during installations and integrated system tests we are asked similar questions at each occasion. We try therefore to focus the documentation on this site to pragmatic and hands-on instructions and explanations of the Common-EGSE and the Test Scripts.

The documentation that is made available on this site is broken up in the following manuals:

Developer Manual::
Information for the software engineer who needs an in-depth understanding of the Common-EGSE. This provides an explanation of the design, the code and how to contribute in both the core egse and the device drivers.

User Manual::
Information for the test operator on how to use the system to perform the camera tests and monitor important test parameters.

Installation Manual::
Information for the system administrator on how to install and configure the operating system, Common-EGSE, user account etc.
