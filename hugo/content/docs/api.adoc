The CGSE API Documentation provides the API code documentation that is generated directly from the source docstrings.

The API docs are generated by `pdoc3` as an external source and accessible from this site. You might want to open the link in a new browser tab.

The current API documentation corresponds to the CGSE Release 2024.7.0.
