== Abstract

This document describes the software and hardware interfaces for the PLATO Common-EGSE, which is used at CSL and the test houses at IAS, INTA and SRON.

This ICD defines all the connections between the components in the instrument test setup that interface with the Common-EGSE. It defines these interface in terms of hardware, i.e. cables, connectors, electrical properties, and in terms of software, i.e. communication protocols, message buffers, timing, data formats etc.
