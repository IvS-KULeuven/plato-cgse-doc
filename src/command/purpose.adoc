== Purpose

This document describes the concepts and some practicalities relative to the commanding of the PLATO Cameras (AEU, FEE) and various GSEs to be controlled during the ground-based testing of the PLATO Cameras.

The document shall be used to train members of the PLATO camera test team in operating the Common-EGSE system and write commanding scripts for camera-level tests.

The present version still contains a few ‘TBW’, some of which will be filled thanks to inputs from the Test Houses (TH), describing the location-specific GSE controls.
