=== Examples of CCD acquisition timing sequence

*Commanding:* To keep notations light, the building blocks in the examples below are presented directly at the python prompt, but in operations they will be refused outside of either another function or building-block, or (if they by themselves constitute the entire test) an execute() command (see <<test-execution>>).

*Timing:* In all cases, our time reference starts at the pulse triggering

[loweralpha]
. the commanded configuration
. the readout of CCD 1 (integrating previously, but readout under the new configuration)

In most cases, as long as the cycle-time and the ccd_order remain unchanged by the configuration occurring at t = 0, the images read out during the first cycle can probably be used directly since, e.g. the just commanded partial readout would be applied. This must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. It will make a difference of one cycle wrt the first moment where a representative set of images corresponding to the new configuration has been recorded. This explains why an apparently redundant cycle is represented in all examples below.

--> This commented out since ALT mode is not implemented <--

For instance, in the example of <<ex-4-ccd-alt-e-f>>, if the images acquired during cycle 1 can be used, the 4 CCDs will be covered in 2 cycles, i.e. the FEE can be reconfigured after 2 long pulses, at t=50; else another cycle will be necessary and a new configuration can only be commanded after t = 72.75, to take effect on t=75 seconds.

[#app-b-fov]
=== Field of view representation with visited positions in CSL

Starting a GUI on the operator screen showing the FOV:
----
$ visited_positions_ui
----
Then you can add the visited locations as follows:

* in focal-plane coordinates (x_fp, y_fp) [mm]:
+
----
>>> from egse.visitedpositions import visit_focal_plane_position +
>>> visit_focal_plane_position(x_fp, y_fp)
----
* in CCD coordinates (row, column) [pixel] on a given CCD:
+
----
>>> from egse.visitedpositions import visit_ccd_position +
>>> visit_ccd_position(row, column, ccd_code)
----
* in field angles (theta, phi) [degrees]:
+
----
>>> from egse.visitedpositions import visit_field_angles +
>>> visit_field_angles(theta, phi)
----

At each of these locations, a red dot will appear on the plot. You can switch between coordinate system (used in the plot) with the combobox below the plot window (focal-plane coordinates, pixel coordinates, and field angles).

.Visited positions gui. From the commanding script you can launch the gui visible to the operator and add positions (red dots) to visualise the progress of a measurement.
image::../images/visited-positions-gui.png[]


Alternatively, you can fire up this GUI with
----
$ visited_positions_ui
----
and add the visited locations with the following commands:

* in focal-plane coordinates (x_fp, y_fp) [mm]:
+
----
>>> visit_focal_plane_position(x_fp, y_fp)
----
* in CCD coordinates (row, column) [pixel] on a given CCD:
+
----
>>> visit_ccd_position(row, column, ccd_code)
----
* in field angles (theta, phi) [degrees]:
+
----
>>> visit_field_angles(theta, phi)
----

These commands can be used in test scripts, to visualise visited positions, without having to pass on the GUI object (or checking for its existence). In case the GUI has been fired up, the positions will be marked in the GUI. If not, nothing will happen (no error will occur).

In `camtest.commanding.csl_gse`, there are a couple of building blocks to move the mechanisms (i.e. hexapod and stages) such that the point sources falls on a specified position:

----
>>> point_source_to_fov(theta, phi)
>>> point_source_to_fp(x, y)
----
When executing these building blocks, a red dot will be added to the GUI, marking that position (in case the GUI was fired up).

[appendix]
=== What should be started where?

On the EGSE server:

* The core services (Process Manager, Configuration Manager, Storage
Manager, and Logging) should be running at all times. Ideally the EGSE
server is configured in a way that these services will be re-started
automatically in case they would go down.
* If you want to start the Control Servers for the devices on the
command line: do it here (but probably you'll want to launch them from
the PM UI (see below)).
* The FITS generator.
* The housekeeping generator for the N-FEE.

On the EGSE client:

* All GUIs should be started here (Process Manager UI, Configuration
Manager UI, Setup UI, DPU UI, FOV UI, etc.).
* You can start the Control Server for the devices from the PM UI. By
doing so, these processes will be started on the EGSE server.
* Executing scripts, commands,...

[appendix]
=== Generating FITS files off-line

It sometimes happens that the FITS files need to be re-processed
off-line for some observations. This can be done, based on the relevant
HDF5 files that are stored in the daily folders for the OD(s) during
which the observation took place. Preferably, this is done on the EGSE
server of the TH, with the following command:
----
$ fitsgen for-obsid <obsid>
----
This will use the default data location from the
`PLATO_DATA_STORAGE_LOCATION` environment variable. It is possible to use
a different data location, as follows:
[%nowrap]
----
$ fitsgen for-obsid <obsid> --location <full path to the data folder (in which obs and daily can be found)>
----
Note that it can be dangerous to run the off-line FITS generation on the
client or server during testing, as it could overload the Storage
Manager. In case you would do this on a dedicated machine (with the same
commands), preferably over VNC (as some observation take a long time to
be processed), you need:

* a full installation of plato-common-egse (make sure to use a release);
* a checkout of plato-cgse-conf;
* a running Storage Manager;
* access to the data folder (with sub-folders /daily (in which the HDF5
files reside) and /obs (in which the FITS files will be stored)) from
the machine on which you will launch the FITS generation.

Before you can go ahead, make sure that there are no FITS files in the
folder for this observation (remove them if there would be any)!
