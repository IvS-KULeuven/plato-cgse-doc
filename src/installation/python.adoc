[NOTE]
.Use Python 3.8+

This code is written for **Python 3** and uses features of Python 3.8 (e.g. walrus operator), so make sure you have at least Python 3.8 installed and configured on your system before trying any of the guides. You can find installation instructions below.


=== Python Download Pages

Download the required version of Python from the https://www.python.org/downloads/[official Python download website].  When you press the "Download" button, you should automatically be re-directed to the download page for your operating system.

After the download has completed, execute the package file and follow the instructions during the installation process.

For macOS 10.9 or higher, this will install Python in the dedicated system folder
`/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/<version number>`. For Linux a tarball with the latest release is available.  For Windows you can download an executable installer or a ZIP file, dependening on your preferences.

=== Anaconda

[WARNING]
.Python on operational system

Make sure you install the official release of Python on any operational machine and **not** the Anaconda distribution. There are too many dependency problem to solve for the Anaconda installation.

On you development machine, you can, alternatively, install Python with the https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/[Anaconda distribution].  This comes with the benefit of installing many additional packages for development, data analysis, and visualisation. Anaconda however nests itself into your system and makes it's difficult to set up environments without the interference of Anaconda. It also uses it's own package management and update script instead of the standard Python distribution with `pip`. Make sure you know what your doing before using this option.

Links to the download pages (follow the instruction listed there):

* https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/[for macOS]
* https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/[for Linux]
* https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/[for Windows]

Upon installation, the following questions will pop up:

* accept license: yes
* where to install it
* initialise Anaconda in your `.bashrc`: no
* whether VS Code should be installed (source code editor): optional

This completes the Anaconda installation.
