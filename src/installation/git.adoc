== Installing and configuring Git and GitHub

The `plato-common-egse` code is under version control in https://github.com/[GitHub].  To be able to get the latest version of the code on your local machine and to share possible contributions with other people in the project, you need to install Git on your computer. Git is probably already installed on your system, check it with the `git --version` command in your terminal. On my system it gives:

----
$ git --version
git version 2.32.1 (Apple Git-133)
----

Installation instructions for your operating system can be found on the https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git reference documentation].

=== Access to GitHub Repository

The `plato-common-egse` code is located in a https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/plato-common-egse[private repository on GitHub].  To be able to access it, we have to grant you access explicitly. Please, send your GitHub username to the development team and you will be granted read access to the repository.  You will then get an invitation by email to join.

If you have not done so already, you can make an https://github.com/join[account on GitHub] for free.

=== Forking & Cloning the Repository

The `plato-common-egse` repository can be found on the https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/plato-common-egse[IvS-KULeuven GitHub pages].  This repository is referred to as **upstream**.

This section describes the process how to install a copy of the repository on your local machine. Note that this is a two step process as shown in the diagram below.

==== Fork a repository

When you not only want use the code but also contribute to it, you have to _fork_ this repository.  To do this,  go to the https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/plato-common-egse[upstream GitHub page], shown below.

XXXXX: we need a new picture here of the plato-common-egse!

Press the `â‘‚Fork` button at the top right (encircled in red in the screenshot above) and follow the instructions.  Your personal copy of the `plato-common-egse` repository will then show up on your personal GitHub pages.  This copy is referred to as **origin**.


==== Clone a repository

To create a local copy of the repository, you should _clone_ it to a designated directory on your local machine with the following command. This will create a folder `plato-common-egse` in the `~/git` directory.

----
$ cd ~/git
$ git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/plato-common-egse.git
----

After executing these steps, you should see the following:

* on your personal GitHub page: the forked repository;
* on your local machine: a local copy (i.e. clone) of the repository in the `~/git` folder.


=== Remote Repositories

We are working with several developers on this Common-EGSE software and the master repository that will merge all changes from different developers is called **((upstream))**. You will have to update your local copy regularly with those changes from other developers. That process is called _pull_ changes from upstream.

To pull the latest version of the upstream software into your local copy, add **upstream** to your list of remote repositories.  To check your list of remote repositories, execute the following command in the installation folder (or one of its sub-folders):

----
$ git remote -v
----

This should give output, similar to this:

[%nowrap]
----
origin	https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/plato-common-egse.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/plato-common-egse.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/plato-common-egse.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/plato-common-egse.git (push)
----

If there's no sign of the `upstream` (the last two lines), you can add it with the following command:

[%nowrap]
----
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/plato-common-egse.git
----

In case you pointed `upstream` to the wrong location (e.g. you used the command from above with the wrong link), you can undo this by executing the following command in the installation folder (or one of its sub-folders):

----
$ git remote rm upstream
----
