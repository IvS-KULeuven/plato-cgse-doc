== Update the Test Scripts to the latest release

When you need to update the test scripts on your `egse-client` machine, use the following commands:
----
$ cd ~/git/plato-test-scripts
$ update_ts
----

We do not have an up-to-date release strategy yet for the test scripts. The command above will install the latest version from the develop branch. Therefore, only update the test scripts when a new release is created on the GitHub repository. That will assure the updates have at least been verified and reviewed.

To know the version of the test scripts that is installed on your machine, use the following command:
----
$ python3 -m camtest.version
$ CAMTEST git version = 2022.2.11-IAS-TS-0-g5eeca72  <1>
----
<1> The version that is presented here is explained in the developer manual in xref:../develop/summary.adoc#version-numbers[Version Numbers].
