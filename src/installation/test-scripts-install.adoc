[#test-scripts-install]
== Installing the Test Scripts

The installation will be done as the `plato-data` user. We will _clone_ the IvS-KULeuven `plato-test-scripts` repository. There is no need to _fork_ because we will not develop from this account and will therefore not do any pushes or  pull requests.

Create a `~/git` folder in the home directory of the `plato-data` user, move into that directory and clone the GitHub repository. Then move into the `plato-test-scripts` folder that was created by the __clone__ command. If this is a first-time installation, you must first create a deploy key for the `plato-test-scripts`, see <<github-deploy>>.
----
$ mkdir -p ~/git
$ cd git
$ git clone git@repo-test-scripts:IvS-KULeuven/plato-test-scripts.git
$ cd plato-test-scripts/
----

Now, make a virtual environment for your `plato-test-scripts` installation:
----
$ python3 -m venv venv --prompt 'TS-venv'
$ source venv/bin/activate
