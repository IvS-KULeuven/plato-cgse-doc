== TODO

- [ ] Describe the deploy keys that are needed for updates of TS, and for upload of Setups.
- [ ] Describe that we need a link from `/data/IAS/conf` to `~/git/plato-cgse-conf/data/IAS/conf`. That link will then point to the same folder on the egse-client machine also.
- [ ] Describe how to NFS mount the /data folder on the `egse-client`
- [ ] Describe the `/cgse/env.txt` file
