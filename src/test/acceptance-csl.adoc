* Each of the pull requests that go into a release shall have proper unit tests and regression testing for all changes in the code and associated data.

* Devices shall have a possibility to run in simulation mode to perform functional unit tests and system tests. Simulators can be gradually enhanced to enable features that are crucial for operations.

== Switch on the EGSE hardware

=== Purpose

Turn on all the hardware components, even if you are not going to use them in the short term.

=== Actions

- [ ] Power on the egse-server
- [ ] Power on the egse-client
- [ ] Power on the AEU Test EGSE
- [ ] Power on the Diagnostic SpaceWire interface (DSI)
- [ ] Power on the facility DAQ -> Keithley DAQ-6510
- [ ] Power on the Symétrie Hexapod Controller
- [ ] Power on the Symétrie HUBER Stages Controller

Then log into the egse-client desktop as user `plato-data` and open a Terminal window where you are logged into the egse-client and another Terminal window where you are logged into the egse-server (also on the server, log in as user `plato-data`).


== Installation Tests

Reference: Installation Manual, PLATO-KUL-PL-MAN-0002

=== Purpose

We assume that an initial installation has already been performed and the system worked as expected. We will perform an installation of a new release of both the CGSE and the TS.

Install the Common-EGSE on a separate machine which is not an operational machine. This should not be the developer installation either, but the operational installation. The purpose of this test is to check the following:

* Can the installation be done without errors?
  ** The initial installation of the CGSE and TS is described in the link:installation-manual.html[installation manual].
  ** Update the Common-EGSE with the command: `update_cgse ops --tag=<release tag>`
  ** Test scripts are updated with: `update_ts`

* Are the Common-EGSE and the required third-party packages installed in the expected location?
  ** The installation should be at `/cgse`, packages in `/cgse/lib/python`, scripts and apps in `/cgse/bin`.

* Can the core services be restarted?
  ** Core services are managed by Systemd and can be restarted by the command: `systemctl restart log_cs cm_cs sm_cs pm_cs syn_cs`


=== Actions

Some actions need to be done on the egse-client, other actions on the egse-server. This is indicated in each of the items below.

- [ ] `egse-client`: Stop all control servers from the `pm_ui` (stop button in the toolbar). You will see an hourglass appearing for each of the devices control servers. Wait until all hourglasses turn into the green play button.

- [ ] `egse-client`: Stop the file generation services in `pm_ui` (under "File Generation Processes")

  * FITS generation
  * FOV HK
  * N-FEE HK

- [ ] `egse-client`: Stop the Process Manager GUI, `pm_ui`

- [ ] `egse-server`: Stop the core services

  $ cd ~/git/plato-common-egse
  $ invoke stop-core-egse

- [ ] `egse-server`: Check for orphan control servers not stopped and kill those processes from the terminal

  $ ps -ef | grep "_cs|fee|fov|das"
  $ kill <PID>

- [ ] `egse-server`: install the new release of the CGSE. Release tags are described in the link:developer-manual.html#version-numbers[Developer Manual].

  $ cd ~/git/plato-common-egse
  $ update_cgse ops --tag=<release tag>
