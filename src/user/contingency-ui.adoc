== The Contingency GUI
:imagesdir: ../images

This section describes the Contingency Tasks GUI. The GUI is a Task GUI based on the `gui-executor` Python package. The GUI has the following components (aka panels).

* A toolbar for managing the Python kernel and opening a Python Console window.
* A panel containing all the tasks. The tasks are grouped by type or component, e.g. tasks for the N-FEE or the TCS or tasks that manage observations. The panel is scrollable when more groups or tasks are available than can fit in the available space.
* An arguments panel that is shown when a task is selected (in the figure below that is `set_trp1`) and which allows you to enter parameters that will be passed into the task. You can also specify here how you want the task to be run.
* An output panel where the output of the task will appear.

The idea of the Contingency Task GUI is to provide you with a clear overview of the contingency tasks, a simple way to customize the task by specifying parameters and run the task with immediate feedback all in the same GUI app. A contingency task is an action that is needed to recover from a failure state or to put the system into a defined state.

Let's explain what happens when you execute the tasks.

As an example, if you press the `set_trp1` task button, it will change color to indicate this task has been selected (see screenshot above) and an arguments panel will appear in the middle of the GUI. The `set_trp1` task expects one parameter (`temperature`) for which no default was provided. The expected input is a float. When you press the `Run` button, the task will be executed _in the kernel_. All tasks are by default executed in the kernel. You will sometimes see that a task will execute in the GUI App or as a script, don't use those options yourself unless you know what you are doing.
