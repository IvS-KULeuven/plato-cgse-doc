== The Contingency GUI

This section describes the Contingency Tasks GUI. The GUI is a Task GUI based on the `gui-executor` Python package. The GUI has the following components (aka panels).

* A toolbar for managing the Python kernel and opening a Python Console window.
* A panel containing all the tasks. The tasks are grouped by type or component, e.g. tasks for the N-FEE or the TCS or tasks that manage observations.
* An arguments panel (shown when a task is selected, in the figure below that is `set_trp1`) which allows you to enter parameters that will be passed into the task. You can also specify here how you want the task to be run.
* An output panel where the output of the task will appear.

The idea of the Contingency Task GUI is to provide you with a clear overview of the contingency tasks, a simple way to customize the task by specifying parameters and run the task with immediate feedback all in the same GUI app.

Let's explain what happens when you execute the tasks.

As an example, if you press the `set_trp1` task button, it will change color to indicate this task has been selected (see screenshot above) and an arguments panel will appear in the middle of the GUI. The `set_trp1` task expects one parameter (`temperature`) for which no default was provided. The expected input is a float. When you press the `Run` button, the task will be executed _as a script_
