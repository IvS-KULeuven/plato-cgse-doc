== Update the Common-EGSE Software


----
update_cgse develop
----

To update the Common-EGSE on the operational machine, use the `ops` argument instead. An operational installation is different from a developer installation. There is no virtual environment and the all required Python packages, including the Common-EGSE are installed at a specific location. The installation process makes use of the following environment variables:

* `PLATO_COMMON_EGSE_PATH`: the location of the plato-common-egse repository
on your machine, e.g., `~/git/plato-common-egse`

* `PLATO_INSTALL_LOCATION`: the location where the packages shall be
installed, usually `/cgse`

----
update_cgse ops --tag=2022.2.2-<TH>-CGSE

The `<TH>` must be replaced with the test house name, CSL, IAS, INTA, or SRON.
