== The Tasks GUI
:imagesdir: ../images

The Tasks GUI is a collective noun for all the task GUIs that we use in our CGSE and TS environment. All these GUIs have the same principle user interface since they are all based on the same Python package that generates the Graphical interface and executes the code. That package is `gui-executor` which is under development at the institute of astronomy at KU Leuven. The `gui-executor` package is open-source and can be installed from PyPI with `pip`:
----
python3 -m pip install gui-executor
----

This chapter explains how the `gui-executor` and therefore the Task GUIs can be used to ease your work in executing scripts and procedures. This chapter is focussed on the user of the GUI, if you are a develop and need coding information on the `gui-executor`, please refer to the _Developer Manual_ xref:../developer-manual.html#tasks-gui[tasks-gui]

There are four distinct parts in the Task GUI: (1) the toolbar with actions for the Python kernel, (2) the button panel with all the tasks arranged by groups in columns of four tasks., (3) an arguments panel, and (4) the output console.

We will explain all of these panels in more detail next.

=== The Toolbar

The toolbar is dedicated to the Python kernel that is used to execute the tasks. The left-most button can be used to restart the kernel. Do this when you want to start a fresh new Python Interpreter or when you need to change the kernel. The second button on the toolbar is used to open a Python Console that is connected to the currently running kernel. Pressing this button will open a window with a prompt where you can enter or paste Python code to be executed. Here you can also find back the code that was executed by pressing one of the buttons.

| image:python-console.png[] | In the screenshot on the left, I have entered two lines of Python code, but you see already that the line number starts with `[4:]`. That means I have already executed three blocks or lines of code. Some of that code was executed by the application right after starting the kernel, other code was generated and executed by pressing a button.

You might ask why you would need to change the kernel? Normally, you don't need to do this and you can simply execute code from the Python prompt or by pressing buttons and running tasks. But it might happen that the kernel crashed or hangs due to a bug in the executed code. At that point you would need to restart the kernel. A second reason is when you want to use another kernel from the drop-down menu at the right end of the toolbar. By default, the _plato-test-scripts_ kernel will be started if it is available, otherwise the fall-back kernel is _python3_. Please note that only one kernel can be managed from this application, and you can also open only one Python Console window.

=== The Button Panel

All tasks are available in the _Button Panel_. The tasks are arranged in groups and in each group in columns of four tasks.

=== The Arguments Panel

When you press a task button an associated arguments panel will appear below the button panel. Before pressing the _Run_ button you can provide input for all the parameters of the task. Most of the arguments will have a simple builtin type like int, float or bool, but more complex argument types are possible and for some of those a special icon will appear on the right side to

=== The Output Console
