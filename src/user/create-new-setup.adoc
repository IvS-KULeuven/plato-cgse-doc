== Creating a new Setup


XXXXX: move this section to the commanding manual <---------


* A new Setup shall be created on the operational system and will, when submitted, become active in the configuration manager.
* The `submit_setup()` function returns the new Setup or a Failure object. Be careful to catch the return value in the existing setup variable, because you will loose your changes when a Failure is returned instead.

----
response = submit_setup(setup, description)
if isinstance(response, Setup):
    setup = response
else:
    print(response)
