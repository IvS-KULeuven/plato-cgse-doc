== The CSL Operator GUI
:imagesdir: ../images

This section briefly describes the CSL specific task GUI, the _CSL Operator GUI_.

The intent of the _CSL Operator GUI_ is to simplify the work of the test operator at CSL when executing routine tasks to perform the alignment of the PLATO Cameras. At the top of the GUI you will find the tasks for taking a single position measurement, a circle around the optical axis, and a Hartmann measurement. Each of these task groups has a task to do the actual commanding and a task to reduce and analyse the data. Then, there are tasks that are grouped by components like the PUNA Hexapod, the Camera, OGSE, etc. Each of these groups contain tasks to perform a specific action on that component. When you hover over the tasks with your mouse, the documentation for that task will show up in a tooltip. Alternatively, you can right click on a task and select _View source..._ to inspect the source for for the task.
