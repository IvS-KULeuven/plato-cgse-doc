== Date, Time and Timestamps

This section explains how and where time is used in the CGSE code and in the data.

*What goes in?*

- [x] the format_datetime() function
- [ ] timestamps in the CSV files
- [ ] timestamps in the HDF5 files
- [ ] timestamps in the FITS files
- [ ] timestamps in the log files
- [ ] timestamps in Grafana
- [ ] UTC versus local time
- [ ] time synchronisation -> NTP or otherwise

=== Formatting the date and time

In the `egse.system` module we have provided a few functions to work with datetime in a consistent way. The most important is the `format_datetime()` function which is used for instance to create the timestamps for all CSV housekeeping data files.

[python]
----
>>> format_datetime()
'2022-06-01T07:47:25.672+0000'
----
The format that is returned by default is `"YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS.Î¼s+0000"` which means the time is expressed in UTC. The function has a few optional parameters that allows to tune the returned string. This should be used only for specific purposes, use the default always to generate a timestamp for your data.

If you need to parse the timestamp string returned by the `format_datetime()` function, use the following format string: `"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f%z"`. We might provide a `parse_datetime()` function in the future to standardize and simplify the parsing of datetime objects.

----
>>> datetime.strptime(format_datetime(), "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f%z")
datetime.datetime(2022, 6, 1, 8, 22, 3, 686000, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
----

If you need a specific date without time, the `format_datetime()` function takes a string argument that you can use to get the date of today, yesterday, tomorrow and the day before yesterday. This might be useful in scheduling tasks.

----
>>> format_datetime('yesterday)
'20220531'
>>> format_datetime('yesterday', fmt="%d/%m/%Y")
'31/05/2022'
----
