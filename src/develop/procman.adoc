==	The Process Manager

The job of the process manager is to keep track of running processes during the Camera Tests.

There are known processes that should be running all the time, i.e. the configuration manager, and the Storage Manager. Then, there are device control servers that are dependent on the Site and the Setup at that site. The process manager needs to know which device control servers are available and how to contact them. That information is available in the configuration manager. We need to decide how the interface between the PM and the CM looks like and what information is exchanged in which format.
