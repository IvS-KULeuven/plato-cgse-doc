== Setting up ssh access and GitHub deploy keys

XXXXX: What is this section, why is it here? For whom is this useful and where /when should it be used?

=== plato-common-egse

* ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your email address>"
** name of the file: `id_cgse_egse_server_<TH>`
* copy the content of `id_cgse_egse_server_<TH>.pub` into the deploy keys @ GitHub
**name is plato-data@egse-server (id_cgse_egse_server_<TH>)
* add the following lines to ~/.ssh/config

[source]
----
Host repo-common-egse
    Hostname github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_cgse_egse_server_<TH>
----

* make sure the files in `~/.ssh` have the right permissions

[source]
----
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config
----

* add a remote for doing the updates

[%nowrap,source]
----
git remote add updates git@repo-common-egse:IvS-KULeuven/plato-common-egse.git
----

* then perform an update:
** if this is the first-time-install:

    export PYTHONPATH=/cgse/lib/python:~/git/plato-common-egse/src
    git fetch updates
    git checkout tags/<release tag> -b <release tag>-branch
    python setup.py install --force --home=/cgse/

** for existing installations, a new command has been implemented that automates the above update procedure:

    update_cgse ops --tag=<release tag>

XXXXX: this should go into the installation guide

[WARNING]
====
You might experience a problem of one or more core services not starting, not even after issuing a restart command on Systemd:

    systemctl restart log_cs sm_cs cm_cs pm_cs

*  the problem is reported as `(code=exited, status=200/CHDIR)` when you run a `systemctl status` command for the service.
*  the service files contain a WorkingDirectory pointing to `~/workdir` and that folder did not exist on the machine.

=== plato-test-scripts

* ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <your email address>
** name of the file: `id_ts_egse_client_<TH>`
* copy the content of `id_ts_egse_client_<TH>.pub` into the deploy keys @ GitHub
** name is plato-data@egse-client (id_ts_egse_client_<TH>)
* add the following lines to `~/.ssh/config`

    Host repo-test-scripts
        Hostname github.com
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ts_egse_client_csl

* make sure the files in `~/.ssh` have the right permissions

    chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config

* add a remote for doing the updates

    git remote add updates git@repo-test-scripts:IvS-KULeuven/plato-test-scripts.git

* if you had not yet installed the repo, clone it

    git clone git@repo-test-scripts:IvS-KULeuven/plato-test-scripts.git

* on a first-time-installation, perform an update as follows:

    git fetch updates
    git rebase updates/develop
    python -m pip install -e .

* otherwise:

    update_ts


=== plato-cgse-conf

Basically the same procedure as for the previous two repos, except for plato-cgse-conf using the configuration manager: when you add the deploy key to GitHub, you must check the _Allow write access_ checkbox. That will allow the configuration manager to upload new Setups to the repo.

For the configuration manager, we will also name the remote ‘upload’ (instead of 'updates').

[source]
----
git remote add upload git@repo-cgse-conf:IvS-KULeuven/plato-cgse-conf.git
----

The following environment variable is needed in `/cgse/env.txt`:

[source,bash]
----
export PLATO_CONF_REPO_LOCATION=/home/plato-data/git/plato-cgse-conf
----

Make sure that the branch has the upload/main as its tracking branch:

[source,bash]
----
$ git branch -u upload/main
$ git branch -vv
* main 17fb23c [upload/main] change filter wheels parameters  # <1>
----
<1> between square brackets is the remote/branch that is tracked.
