==	The System Under Test (SUT) â€“ DPU Processor and FEE Simulator

* Commanding is the same as all other devices, DPU Control Server and Controller, Proxy, etc
* DPU Processor as a separate thread to communicate to the FEE (Simulator)
* DPU Protocol starts the DPU Processor process
* DPU Controller and DPU Processor communicate via three Queues, the command queue, the response queue, and a priority queue.
* Timing: timecode packet, HK packet, [Data packets], Commanding through RMAP requests

Commands that are given on the Python prompt are by definition synchronous meaning when you call a function or execute a building block, the function or building block will wait for its return value before finishing. This is usually not a problem, because we most of the time have a pretty good idea how long a calculation or action will take. Most functions return within a few hundred milliseconds or less, which is practically immediate. When commanding the FEE however, things are more complicated. The FEE has strict timing when it comes to commanding. During the sync period (usually 6.25s unless commanded different) there is a slot of at least 2s at the end of the period, which is reserved for commanding. The sync period starts with a timecode packet followed by the FEE housekeeping packet. That takes just a few milliseconds. Depending on the FEE mode, we can then expect data packets filling up until 4s after the time code. There can be less or no data packets, leaving more time for commanding. Commanding the FEE is done by sending SpaceWire RMAP requests to the FEE in that 2s+ timeslot. When we send a command from the Python prompt to the FEE, it arrives in the Queue at the DPU Processor and will be send to the FEE in the next 2s+ command timeslot. When the Command enters the Queue at the beginning of the readout period, i.e. right after the timecode, maximum 4s will pass before the command is actually send to and executed on the FEE. All this time, the Python prompt will be blocked while waiting for the response. The next command can only be sent on return of the previous. So, we have two issues to solve, (1) the duration and blocking of all the steps in the commanding chain, and (2) sending more than just one command to the FEE in the same timeslot.
