== Core Services

What are considered core services?

The ((core services)) are provided by five control servers that run on the egse-server  machine: the log manager, the configuration manager, the storage manager, the process manager, and the synoptics manager. Each of these services is installed as a _systemd_ service on the operational machine. That means they are monitored by the system and when one of these processes crashes, it is automatically restarted. As a developer, you can start the core services on your local machine or laptop with the `invoke` command from a terminal.

$ cd ~/git/plato-common-egse
$ invoke start-core-egse

The services are described in full detail in the following sections.
