== Testing device Interfaces

There are several ways to test device interfaces since we have layered access to the devices. The direct access to a device is usually implemented in a `<device_name>_devif.py` module. If the device has an Ethernet connection, the class is usually called `<device_name>EthernetInterface`, e.g. `OGSEEthernetInterface`, for USB connected devices this would be `<device_name>USBInterface`, e.g. PM100AUSBInterface`.

When you have direct access to the device and it is not used in an operational environment, you can test the interface from the `Controller` class
