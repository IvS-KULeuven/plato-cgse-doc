building block::
    A special function in the test scripts that must be executed within the context of an observation. Building blocks have special restrictions on arguments too, see XXXXX.
Core EGSE::
    Five services are considered core services: logger, configuration control, storage, processes, and synoptic monitoring.
control server::
    A server that provide control to a device or one of the core services.
EAFP::
    itâ€™s Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission
GlobalState::
    Defines the state of the system at the current time. Don't use this in the CGSE code, this is intended for test scripts and building blocks.
LBYL::
    Look Before You Leap
Observation::
    A top level building block that is executed directly from the REPL.
Proxy::
    TBW
Protocol::
    TBW
REPL::
A Python REPL is the interactive Python shell that you get when starting a Python Console in PyCharm or when starting `ipython` in a terminal. The acronym REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop, i.e. it reads your input, evaluates this input, prints the result and then waits for the next inputs.

service::
    A service is provided usually by a server which supports specific functionality such as e.g. storage of data, or configuration control services. Often the Core EGSE control servers and the service they provide are used interchanged.
SUT::
    Stands for **S**ystem **U**nder **T**est and resembles the PLATO Cameras at the different test houses.
