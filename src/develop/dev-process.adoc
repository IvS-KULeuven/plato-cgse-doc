== Development Process

This chapter describes the development process that we adhere to for the Common-EGSE and test scripts.

* develop branch versus main
* Patch release branches? When do we branch? When is the branch finished? Do we delete older branches?
* Test houses stay on a patch release branch for the duration of a camera test campaign, then they install the latest agreed development branch and run the EGSE IST
* How to create patches on your TH branch?
* how to merge changes back into develop?
* Why are we not using a main branch? Should we? YES
* What is the purpose of the CCB? When does it take place?
* A little more about version number of patches
* Explain issues, pull requests, and milestones
* who assigns labels?
* bumping
* releases on the main branch
