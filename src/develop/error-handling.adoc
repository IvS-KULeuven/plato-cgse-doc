== Best Practices for Error and Exception Handling

(((Exception)))
All errors and exceptions should be handled to prevent the Application from crashing. This is definitely true for server applications and services, e.g. device control servers, the storage and configuration manager. But also GUI applications should not crash due to an unhandled exception. It is important that, at least on the server side, all exceptions are logged.


=== When do I catch exceptions?

Exceptions shouldn't really be caught unless you have a really good plan for how to recover. If you have no such plan, let the exception propagate to a higher level in your software until you know how to handle it. In your own code, try to avoid raising an exception in the first place, design your code and classes such that you minimise throwing exceptions.

If some code path simply must broadly catch all exceptions (i.e. catch the base `Exception` class) — for example, the top-level loop for some long-running persistent process — then each such caught exception must write the full stack trace to the log, along with a timestamp. Not just the exception type and message, but the full stack trace. This can easily be done in Python as follows:

[source,python]
----
try:
    main_loop()
except Exception:
    logging.exception("Caught exception at the top level main_loop().")
----

This will log the exception and stacktrace with logging level ERROR.

For all other except clauses — which really should be the vast majority — the caught exception type must be as specific as possible. Something like `KeyError`, `ConnectionTimeout`, etc. That should be the exception that you have a plan for, that you can handle and recover from at this level in your code.

=== How do I catch Exceptions?

(((try..except)))
Use the `try`/`except` blocks around code that can potentially generate an exception __and__ your code can recover from that exception.

Any resources such as open files or connections can be closed or cleaned up in the _finally_ clause. Remember that the code within `finally` will always be executed, regardless of an Exception is thrown or not. In the example below, the function checks if there is internet connection by opening a socket to a host which is expected to be available at all times. The socket is closed in the finally clause even when the exception is raised.

[source,python]
----
import socket
import logging

def has_internet(host="8.8.8.8", port=53, timeout=3):
    """Returns True if we have internet connection, False otherwise."""
    try:
        socket_ = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        socket_.settimeout(timeout)
        socket_.connect((host, port))
        return True
    except socket.error as ex:
        logging.info(f"No Internet: Unable to open socket to {host}:{port} [{ex}]")
        return False
    finally:
        if socket_ is not None:
            socket_.close()
----


=== What about the 'with' Statement?

When you use a ((`with`)) statement in your code, resources are automatically closed when an Exception is thrown, but the Exception is still thrown, so you should put the `with` block inside a `try`/`except` block.

As of Python 3 the `socket` class can be used as a context manager. The example above can thus be rewritten as follows:

[source,python]
----
import socket
import logging

def has_internet(host="8.8.8.8", port=53, timeout=3):
    """Returns True if we have internet connection, False otherwise."""
    try:
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as socket_:
            socket_.settimeout(timeout)
            socket_.connect((host, port))
            return True
    except socket.error as ex:
        logging.warning(f"No Internet: Unable to open socket to {host}:{port} [{ex}]")
        return False
----

Another example from our own code base shows how to handle a Hexapod PUNA Proxy error. Suppose you want to send some commands to the PUNA within a context manager as follows:

[source,python]
----
from egse.hexapod.symetrie.puna import PunaProxy

with PunaProxy() as proxy:
    proxy.move_absolute(0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0)
    # Send other commands to the Puna Hexapod.
----

When you execute the above code and the PUNA control server is not active, the Proxy will not be able to connect and the context manager will raise a `ConnectionError`.

[source]
----
PunaProxy could not connect to its control server at tcp://localhost:6700. No commands have been loaded.
Control Server seems to be off-line, abandoning
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "t.py", line 3, in <module>
    with PunaProxy() as proxy:
  File "/Users/rik/Git/plato-common-egse/src/egse/proxy.py", line 129, in __enter__
    raise ConnectionError("Proxy is not connected when entering the context.")
ConnectionError: Proxy is not connected when entering the context.
----

So, the `with .. as` statement should be put into a `try .. except` clause. Since we probably cannot handle this exception at this level, we only log the exception and  re-raise the connection error.

[source,python]
----
from egse.hexapod.symetrie.puna import PunaProxy

try:
    with PunaProxy() as proxy:
        proxy.move_absolute(0,0,2,0,0,0)
        # Send other commands to the Puna Hexapod.
except ConnectionError as exc:
    logger.exception("Could not send commands to the Hexapod PUNA because the control server is not reachable.")
    raise  # <1>
----
<1> use a single `raise` statement, don't repeat the `ConnectionError` here

=== Why not just return an error code?

(((Exception, error code)))
In languages like the C programming language is it custom to return error codes or `-1` as a return code from a function to indicate a problem has occurred.
The main drawback here is that your code, when calling such a function, must always check it's return codes, which is often forgotten or ignored.

In Python, throw exceptions instead of returning an error code. Exceptions ensure that failures do not go unnoticed because the calling code didn't check a return value.

=== When to Test instead of Try?

The question basically is if we should check for a common condition without possibly throwing an exception. Python does this different than other languages and prefers the use of exceptions. There are two different opinions about this, ((EAFP)) and ((LBYL)). From the Python documentation:

[discrete]
===== __EAFP__: it's Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission.

This common Python coding style assumes the existence of valid keys or attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption proves false. This clean and fast style is characterized by the presence of many try and except statements. The technique contrasts with the LBYL style common to many other languages such as C.

[discrete]
===== __LBYL__: Look Before You Leap.

This coding style explicitly tests for pre-conditions before making calls or lookups. This style contrasts with the EAFP approach and is characterized by the presence of many if statements. In a multi-threaded environment, the LBYL approach can risk introducing a race condition between “the looking” and “the leaping”.

Consider the following two cases:

[source,python]
----
if response[-2:] != '\r\n':
    raise ConnectionError(f"Missing termination characters in response: {response}")
----

[source,python]
----
def convert_to_float(value: str) -> float:
    try:
        return float(value)
    except ValueError:
        return math.nan
----

If you expect that 90% of the time your code will just run as expected, use the `try`/`except` approach. It will be faster if exceptions really are exceptional. If you expect an abnormal condition more than 50% of the time, then using `if` is probably better.

In other words, the method to choose depends on how often you expect the event to occur.

* Use exception handling if the event doesn't occur very often, that is, if the event is truly exceptional and indicates an error (such as an unexpected end-of-file). When you use exception handling, less code is executed in normal conditions.
* Check for error conditions in code if the event happens routinely and could be considered part of normal execution. When you check for common error conditions, less code is executed because you avoid exceptions.

=== When to re-throw an Exception?

(((raise)))
Sometimes you just want to do something and rethrow the same Exception. This is easy in Python as shown in the following example.

[source,python]
----
try:
    # do some work here
except SomeException:
    logging.warning("...", exc_info=True)
    raise  # <1>
----
<1> use only a `raise` statement, without the `SomeException` added. This will rethrow the exact same exception that was catched.

In some cases, it is best to have the stacktrace printed out with the logging message. I've include the `exc_info=True` in the example.


=== What about Performance?

It is nearly free to set up a `try/except` block (an exception manager), while an `if` statement always costs you.

Bear in mind that Python internally uses exceptions frequently. So, when you use an `if` statement to check e.g. for the existence of an attribute (the `hasattr()` method), this builtin function will call `getattr(obj, name)` and catch `AttributeError`. So, instead of doing the following:

[source,python]
----
if hasattr(command, 'name'):
    command_name = getattr(command, 'name')
else:
    command_name = None
----
you can better use the `try/except`.

[source,python]
----
try:
    command_name = getattr(command, 'name')
except AttributeError:
    command_name = None
----


=== Can I raise my own Exception?

(((Exception, defining your own)))
As a general rule, try to use builtin exceptions from Python, especially `ValueError`, `IndexError`, `NameError`, and `KeyError`. Don't invent your own 'parameter' or 'arguments' exceptions if the cause of the exception is clear from the builtin. The hierarchy of Exceptions can be found in the Python documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy[Builtin-Exceptions > Exception Hierarchy].

When the connection with a builtin exception is not clear however, create your own exception from the `Exception` class.

[source,python]
----
class DeviceNotFoundError(Exception):
    """Raised when a device could not be located or loaded."""
    pass
----
NOTE: Even if we are talking about Exceptions all the time, your own Exceptions should end with `Error` instead of `Exception`. The standard Python documentation also has a section on https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions[User Defined Exceptions] that you might want to read.

In some situations you might want to group many possible sources of internal errors into a single exception with a clear message. For example, you might want to write a library module that throws its own exception to hide the implementation details, i.e. the user of your library shouldn't have to care which extra libraries you use to get the job done.

Since this will hide the original exception, if you throw your own exception, make sure that it contains every bit of information from the originally caught exception. You'll be grateful for that when you read the log files that are send to you for debugging.

The example below is taken from the actual source code. This code catches all kinds of exceptions that can be raised when connecting to a hardware device over a TCP socket. The caller is mainly interested of course if the connection could be established or not, but we always include the information from the original exception with the `raise..from` clause.

[source,python]
----
def connect(self):

    # Sanity checks

    if self.is_connection_open:
        raise PMACException("Socket is already open")
    if self.hostname in (None, ""):
        raise PMACException("ERROR: hostname not initialized")
    if self.port in (None, 0):
        raise PMACException("ERROR: port number not initialized")

    # Create a new socket instance

    try:
        self.sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        self.sock.setblocking(1)
        self.sock.settimeout(3)
    except socket.error as e_socket:
        raise PMACException("ERROR: Failed to create socket.") from e_socket

    # Attempt to establish a connection to the remote host

    try:
        logger.debug(f'Connecting a socket to host "{self.hostname}" using port {self.port}')
        self.sock.connect((self.hostname, self.port))
    except ConnectionRefusedError as e_cr:
        raise PMACException(f"ERROR: Connection refused to {self.hostname}") from e_cr
    except socket.gaierror as e_gai:
        raise PMACException(f"ERROR: socket address info error for {self.hostname}") from e_gai
    except socket.herror as e_h:
        raise PMACException(f"ERROR: socket host address error for {self.hostname}") from e_h
    except socket.timeout as e_timeout:
        raise PMACException(f"ERROR: socket timeout error for {self.hostname}") from e_timeout
    except OSError as e_ose:
        raise PMACException(f"ERROR: OSError caught ({e_ose}).") from e_ose

    self.is_connection_open = True

----


=== When should I use Assertions?

(((assert)))
Use assertions only to check for invariants. Assertions are meant for development and should not replace checking conditions or catching exceptions which are meant for production. A good guideline to use `assert` statements is when they are triggering a bug in your code. When your code assumes something and acts upon the assumption, it's recommended to protect this assumption with an assert. This assert failing means your assumption isn't correct, which means your code isn't correct.

[source,python]
----
def _load_register_map(self):
    # This method shall only be called when self._name is 'N-FEE' or 'F-FEE'.
    assert self._name in ('N-FEE', 'F-FEE')
----

Another example is:

[source,python]
----
# If this assertion fails, there is a flaw in the algorithm above
assert tot_n_args == n_args + n_kwargs, (
    f"Total number of arguments ({tot_n_args}) doesn't match "
    f"# args ({n_args}) + # kwargs ({n_kwargs})"
)
----

[WARNING]
Remember also that running Python with the `-O` option will remove or disable assertions. Therefore, __never__ put expressions from your normal code flow in an assertion. They will not be executed when the optimizer is used and your code will break gracefully.

=== What are Errors?

(((Error)))
This is a naming convention thing... names of user defined sub-classes of Exception should end with `Error`.

XXXXX: TBW

=== Logging Exceptions

Generally, you should not log exceptions at lower levels, but instead throw exceptions and rely on some top level code to do the logging. Otherwise, you'll end up with the same exception logged multiple times at different  layers in your application.
