== The Proxy Class

The Proxy class automatically tries to connect to its control server. When the control server is up and running, the Proxy loads the device commands from the control server. When the control server is not running, a warning is issued, and the device commands are not loaded. If you then try to call one of the device methods, you will get a `NotImplementedError`. The ZeroMQ connection initiated by the Proxy will just sit there until the control server comes up, so you can fix the problem with the control server and call the `load_commands()` method on the Proxy again to load the commands.
