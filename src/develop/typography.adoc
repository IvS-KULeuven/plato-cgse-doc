== Conventions used in this Book

We try to be consistent with the following typographical conventions:

Italic::
Indicates a new term or ...

Constant width::
Used for code listings, as well as within paragraphs to refer to program elements like variable and function names, data type, environment variables (`ALL_CAPS`), statements and keywords.

Constant width between angle brackets `<text>`::
Indicates `text` that should be replaced with user-supplied values or by values determined by context. The brackets should thereby be omitted.

When you see a `$ ...` in code listings, this is a command you need to execute in a terminal (omitting the dollar sign itself). When you see `>>> ...` in code listings, that is a Python expression that you need to execute in a Python REPL (here omitting the three brackets).
